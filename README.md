### Android Developer - Recruitment Task

### Song App

In this repo you will find draft of Android application.
It's very simple concept - fetch list of songs from remote data source and display the data.

We're aware that the quality of prepared code is not the best - it's on purpose.


### The app
The application should fetch list of songs from [remote data source](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/#searchexamples) and displays it.


### Technical interview

During our technical interview, you will be asked to implement missing parts of the application so it would meet it's purpose.

We also love Clean Architecture and polished User Interface so if you are familiar with those feel free to use it.
If you're into Jetpack Compose, please don't hesitate to add needed dependencies before our interview!


### Expectations
- You should explain not only what you're doing but also why you're doing something in given fashion.


### Tips
- App code should be idiomatic - we love Kotlin and we want to see that you do too.
- It’s easier to read the code when it’s well formatted and the code style is consistent.
